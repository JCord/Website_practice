        <p>Age, injuries, and bad luck led to a season that was even more disappointing than last year. They have put all their money into their aging players and had to trade their future star players to pay for the veterans salaries. The Salary cap is what balances the teams in the NHL it's what keeps all the superstars on different teams and doesn't have a big mistake like the NBA's teams. The NHL tries to keep the teams pretty balanced and entertaining for the fans to enjoy.</p>
